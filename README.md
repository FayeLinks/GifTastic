Week 6 homework: 

I created a Giphy Generator using an API from Giphy Developer with personal API Key.

I also used html and javascript for initial creation.

I added css styling as well as Google Fonts and Bootstrap.

I struggled with getting the gifs to appear in selected rows and columns, 
but I was able to succed by introducing a grid in CSS.
